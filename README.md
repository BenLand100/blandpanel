# BLandPanel

This aims to be a reference design for a DYI telescope automated flat panel.
Any RP2040 dev board, or similar device, capable of running MicroPython,
a PWM modulated servo, and some commodity electronics components make up the
electronics. Some Python and C++ for writing the firmware and software driver
(respectively - which is quite ironic) to allow INDI capable clients to control
the device and a bit of CAD and 3D printing to hold it all together.

The flat panel and CAD itself are TBD.
